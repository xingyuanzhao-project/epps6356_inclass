## Shiny Application: Data Visualization Platform

This assignment demonstrates interactive data visualization using Shiny, featuring both built-in R datasets and custom data analysis.

### Application Features

**Task B: Built-in Datasets**

The application includes three classic R datasets with interactive visualizations:

- **mtcars**: Motor Trend Car Road Tests - Explore relationships between variables like MPG, horsepower, and weight with scatter plots and box plots
- **USArrests**: Violent Crime Rates by US State - View top states by crime statistics (Murder, Assault, Urban Population, Rape)
- **uspop**: US Population by Decade (1790-1970) - Visualize historical population growth with line and bar charts

**Task D: CFR Cyber Attacks Data**

Custom dataset analysis featuring:

- Global cyber attack statistics from the Council on Foreign Relations
- Interactive visualizations including horizontal/vertical bar charts, lollipop charts, and distribution plots
- Top N country selector to focus on specific regions
- Real-time statistics showing total attacks, affected countries, and most targeted nation

### Technical Implementation

**Customization (Task A):**

- Custom Arial font family applied throughout the application
- Consistent color scheme with theme options
- Responsive layout with sidebar controls

**Deployment (Task C):**

- Published to shinyapps.io platform
- Application URL: [https://jaketinoz.shinyapps.io/epps6356_assignment6/](https://jaketinoz.shinyapps.io/epps6356_assignment6/)
- Accessible from any web browser

### Data Sources

- **Built-in Datasets**: R's `datasets` package (mtcars, USArrests, uspop)
- **Custom Data**: Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) Cyber Operations Tracker
  - File: `CFR_country_total_with_ISO2 (1).csv`
  - Contains cyber attack counts by country with ISO2 and ISO3 codes

### Key Features

- **Interactivity**: Dynamic controls for dataset selection, variable choice, and visualization type
- **Multiple Visualizations**: Scatter plots, bar charts, line charts, box plots, histograms, and lollipop charts
- **Data Tables**: View raw data alongside visualizations
- **Summary Statistics**: Real-time statistical summaries for all datasets
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes

### Technologies Used

- **R Shiny**: Interactive web application framework
- **ggplot2**: Advanced data visualization
- **dplyr**: Data manipulation and transformation
- **shinyapps.io**: Cloud hosting platform
