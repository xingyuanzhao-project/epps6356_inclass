  Assignment 3  1. Rerun murrell01.R a. Choose one of the six charts and explain how it is configured by adding documentation to the codes. 2. Rerun anscombe01.R (in Teams folder) a. Compare the regression models b. Compare different ways to create the plots (e.g. changing colors, line types, plot characters) 3. Can you finetune the charts without using other packages (consult RGraphics by Murrell)? a. Use a serif font b. Try non-default colors c. Use own plotting character 4. How about with ggplot2? (use tidyverse package) 5. Pre-hackathon by team: a. Team work: Replicate the Scatterplot matrix below (hint: Acquire data using the following codes) b. Send the codes to the TA.  The first team delivering the code and chart will win a prize (by time stamp and product)  ## Download COVID data from OWID GitHub owidall = read.csv("https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/blob/master/public/data/owid-covid-data.csv?raw=true") # Deselect cases/rows with OWID owidall = owidall[!grepl("^OWID", owidall$iso_code), ]  # Subset by continent: Europe owideu = subset(owidall, continent=="Europe")
