    "text": "The source is the Cyber Operations Tracker by Council on Foreign Relations. This comprehensive database documents publicly acknowledged state-sponsored cyber incidents since 2005, cataloging over 500 cyber operations attributed to 34 countries. The data is compiled from open-source intelligence, such as government reports and media coverage.\n\n\n\nThe current data visualization is demonstrated in a simple 2D map format, which limits the ability to convey the complex, multi-dimensional nature of global cyber operations. We are proposing to develop a 3D globe visualization to:\n\nEnhance spatial understanding of cyber attack patterns and geographic relationships\nProvide intuitive interaction through rotation, zooming, and filtering capabilities\nDisplay temporal evolution of cyber incidents through animated timelines\nImprove user engagement with immersive visual storytelling\n\nBeyond the visualization limitations, another critical issue with the original dataset is the ambiguity in its classification system for threat actors and victims. The current coding scheme relies heavily on agency-level attributions and organizational descriptors that often obscure the true nature of the actors involved. For instance, attacks may be attributed to specific intelligence agencies or military units rather than clearly identifying the sponsoring country, while victims are frequently categorized by sector or organization type without clear geographic or jurisdictional mapping. This lack of clarity makes it challenging to analyze patterns of state behavior, understand escalation dynamics, or identify targeting preferences.\nTo address this limitation, we will implement a more robust classification framework that:\n\nDevelops standardized victim categorization across geographic, sectoral, and criticality dimensions\nImplements a multi-label system to capture complex agency levels and their relationships\n\nThis enhanced classification system will not only improve analytical accuracy but also enable more sophisticated visualizations.\n\n\n\nThe data production process will involve the following steps:\n\nData Cleaning and Standardization\n\nNormalize country names and codes to ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 standards\nStandardize date formats and handle missing temporal data\n\nData Structure Design\n\nRestructure the data into proper format for temporal visualization and analysis\nConvert the data into a format compatible with ArcGIS web applications\nDesign relational schema to store the various levels of data into a database\n\nData Enrichment\n\nConcatenate with additional data\n\nOther relational data such as alliances and conflicts\nOther unit attribute level data such as technology capacity, etc.\n\nConvert the cyber incidents into network object data for relational and geographic visualization\nUse LLMs to extract information from the original source to create source level annotation\n\nData Visualization Design\n\nCreate ArcGIS app to visualize the data in 3D globe\nCreate a web app to integrate the geospatial visualization with other levels of data retrieval for user interaction\n\n\n\n\n\nSystem Architecture:\n\n\n\n\n\n%%{init: {'theme':'neutral', 'themeVariables': { 'primaryColor':'#fff','primaryTextColor':'#000','primaryBorderColor':'#000','lineColor':'#000','secondaryColor':'#fff','tertiaryColor':'#fff'}}}%%\nflowchart TD\n    subgraph Backend\n        T1[cyber_operations]\n        T2[country_attributes]\n        T3[alliance_network]\n        T4[conflict_network]\n        DB[(Database)]\n        \n        T1 --&gt; DB\n        T2 --&gt; DB\n        T3 --&gt; DB\n        T4 --&gt; DB\n    end\n    \n    subgraph UI[User Interface]\n        WEB[Web Application]\n        ARC[ArcGIS App with Temporal Adjustment]\n        NET[Network Graphs]\n        MOD[Model Results Displays]\n        \n        WEB --&gt; ARC\n        WEB --&gt; NET\n        WEB --&gt; MOD\n    end\n    \n    DB --&gt; WEB\n    WEB --query--&gt; DB\n    ARC --query--&gt; DB\n    \n    style Backend fill:none,stroke:#000\n    style UI fill:#fff,stroke:#000\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualization Components:\n\n3D Globe (ArcGIS Web Scene): Interactive globe showing cyber operations with animated attack arcs between nations.

The model will leverage geospatial information to test whether border contiguity increases cyber operations when countries are in conflict, capturing how regional tensions and conflicts are coordinated in cyberspace, such as the cyber operations between Ukraine and Russia representing a modern “hybrid warfare” in both cyberspace and physical space.\nTemporal Network Inference: 2. Implement STOAT (Spatial-Temporal Probabilistic Causal Inference Network) for cyber operations (arXiv:2506.09544). This method performs causal inference by incorporating a spatial relation matrix that encodes interregional dependencies between nations, but instead of geographic proximity we use international relations connectivity (alliances, conflicts, technology partnerships). This enables spatially informed causal effect estimation where cyber operations propagate through international relations networks rather than physical space contingencies or proximity."
