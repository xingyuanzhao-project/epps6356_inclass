    "text": "The scatterplot is configured by first setting graphical parameters with par() to control label orientation and margins, then creating an empty plot window with plot.new() and plot.window(), adding two trend lines with lines(), overlaying distinct point styles using points() with different pch values, customizing axis appearance with axis() and par() color parameters, drawing a U-shaped box with box(bty=“u”), and finally labeling axes with mtext() and adding identifying text with text().\nAll four models use identical specifications—same estimator (lm), same formula (y~x), no transformations—differing only in column assignments (x1-x4, y1-y4). The simple version plots with default black points and lines, while the fancy version uses red borders (col=“red”), orange fill (bg=“orange”), triangles (pch=21), larger size (cex=1.2), and blue regression lines, demonstrating how visual customization reveals different data patterns despite identical model specifications."

AI models are allowed but you need to provide the prompts and detail of AI model (e.g. what model and version). c. Codes and products posted on own GitHub website. d. Email TA the url of final product within 48 hours (due time at 10 pm, 10/10/2025). Timestamps determine the top three winners. Prizes will be announced in next class. e. Suggestion: must demonstrate team works instead of individual effort.

You can use any dataset but must cite the source Rules: a. Generate a program to create a chart using either R Graphics or ggplot2 or any R packages (no other methods/software are allowed) b. Codes and products posted on own GitHub website/blog c. Submit to Submission folder. Timestamps determine the top three winners. d. Suggestion: must demonstrate team works instead of individual effort. Pay attention to detail and embellish the chart with design.

This comprehensive database documents publicly acknowledged state-sponsored cyber incidents since 2005, cataloging over 500 cyber operations attributed to 34 countries. The data is compiled from open-source intelligence, such as government reports and media coverage.\n\n\n\nThe current data visualization is demonstrated in a simple 2D map format, which limits the ability to convey the complex, multi-dimensional nature of global cyber operations.
