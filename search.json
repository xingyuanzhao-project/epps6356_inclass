The simple version plots with default black points and lines, while the fancy version uses red borders (col=“red”), orange fill (bg=“orange”), triangles (pch=21), larger size (cex=1.2), and blue regression lines, demonstrating how visual customization reveals different data patterns despite identical model specifications."
