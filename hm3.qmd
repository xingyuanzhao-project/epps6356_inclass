The scatterplot is configured by first setting graphical parameters with par() to control label orientation and margins, then creating an empty plot window with plot.new() and plot.window(), adding two trend lines with lines(), overlaying distinct point styles using points() with different pch values, customizing axis appearance with axis() and par() color parameters, drawing a U-shaped box with box(bty="u"), and finally labeling axes with mtext() and adding identifying text with text().

All four models use identical specifications—same estimator (lm), same formula (y~x), no transformations—differing only in column assignments (x1-x4, y1-y4). The simple version plots with default black points and lines, while the fancy version uses red borders (col="red"), orange fill (bg="orange"), triangles (pch=21), larger size (cex=1.2), and blue regression lines, demonstrating how visual customization reveals different data patterns despite identical model specifications.
